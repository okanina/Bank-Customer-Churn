1.Problem statement

The problem statement for this project is customers who churns banking industry.  customer churn occurs when the customer terminate his/her relationship with a business or organization.

Customer churn affect any business or organization future growth. In this project I intend to use machine Learning techniques to find patterns and then predict customers who would leave Bank XYZ.

2. Data Source

I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.com[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction].It is a csv file, I used pandas to read it into pandas dataframe, whih makes it simpler to analyze the data.It has 10000 observations with 12 features including the target variable.This is a supervised machine learning project which predict a yes or no making it a binary classification problem.

The data has no missing or duplicate values. It consist of 3 datatypes, int64, floats, and objects(string values). It is highly imbalance, with 20.4 % positive class and 79.63 % negative class.

The following are the features present in the dataset:
